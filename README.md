This a physics engine for Inelastic Collisions of particles enclosed in a box many orders of magnitude larger than the particle size(s).
It is based on a vector formalisim incorporating principles of classical mechanics.
This module is part of a larger project aimed at robust physics engine modules encompasing Theoretical Physics.
The current outline includes the following modules each focused on a particular area of basic theoretical physics.
These are:

--> Classical Mechanics.
--> E * M
--> Waves
--> Statistical Physics
--> Quantum Mechanics
--> General Relativity
--> Special Relativity

This repository contains the first part module of the statistical physics sesgment:
"Inelastic Scattering".
